MMJASTA.EXE is a program that generates the log and summary sheets for JASTA Activity Contest, which regularly is held in August.
MMJASTA.EXE reads the log data of MMSSTV, calculates the score and generates the log and summary sheets for JA and non-JA stations.

---------------
1. Setup
---------------
Start MMJASTA.EXE, click on File menu, select Setup, and fill out the form.  The items you have entered are recorded in MMJASTA.INI, so that you will not have to enter them in the next time.
Select Japanese if you are JA, or English if you are not JA.  MMJASTA.EXE generates Japanese or English summary according to this selection.  MMJASTA.EXE automatically selects the language by referring to the Windows locale.

---------------------
2. Load the log file
---------------------
Click on File menu and select Load log.  Specify the log file that is generated by MMSSTV.  The file extension is MDT.  MMJASTA.EXE calculates the sore and generates the log and summary sheets.

MMJASTA.EXE generates the following files in the directory where MMJASTA.EXE exists.
	Log sheet		Callsign.txt
	Summary sheet		Callsign.sum
	Analysis file		Callsign.ana

MMJASTA automatically picks out the contest QSOs by referring to the date and HisRSV fields.  Therefore, the log file can contain non-contest QSOs.

--------------------
DX entities
--------------------
MMJASTA and MMSSTV automatically detect the DX entities and continents in most cases.  If MMJASTA.EXE cannot identify the entity from the call sign, MMJASTA.EXE outputs an error message in the lower window, like below.

194  10/21 1502Z    14 JD1ABC        59940   59999   : DXCC Unknown [JD1/?]

Double click on the error message.  MMJASTA.EXE opens a new window, with which you can edit the multi and continent.  Push the OK button after inputting the correct multi and continent information.  MMJASTA.EXE changes the entry not only in the JASTA log sheet but also in the original MMSSTV log file.
After editing all the DXCC unknown entries, click on File menu and Re-totalize.

* The JASTA contest rule as of 2002 does not take account of continents, but MMJASTA.EXE allows the user to edit the continent field for future use.

-----------------------
4.  Invalid QSO
-----------------------
MMJASTA.EXE treat the QSO invalid if
- Two or more QSOs with the same station on the same day (UTC).  MMJASTA only counts the first QSO.
- Rcvd contest NR is empty
- REM field has NOF or NOFACE.  User should put NOF or NOFACE in the REM field if the face picture was not received.

--------------
5. Note
--------------
MMJASTA automatically calculates the score and generates the log and summary sheets, but DO NOT FORGET TO CHECK ON THE LOG AND SUMMARY SHEETS BY YOURSELF.
This program has just been made and not quite tested.  It is highly likely to have bugs....
